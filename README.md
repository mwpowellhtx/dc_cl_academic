## Screening Questions

Consisted of primarily two skills oriented questions. Both more or less academic in nature, which response is along the same lines. Some things you might do for an academic illustration ought never to be done in and of themselves approaching production quality development.

1. [Design an shapes oriented class library](src/Interview/README.Q1.md)
2. [Design a college registration database schema](src/Interview/README.Q2.md)

Languages and such were basically of my choosing, so I ran with what I know, _CSharp_ _dotnet_ and a _postgresql_ script, both of which I used to verify the response.

### Keystroke Recorders

Screening also consisted of an [InterviewZen](https://interviewzen.com) facilitated response, to which I flatly reject, not least of which on the basis that I am not in the business of permitting nor advertising keystroke playback. The excuse they try to foist upon you is that _how_ you arrive at a solution is important. However, in this line of business, the _how_ has nothing whatsoever to do with any keystrokes, but rather with remaining goal and solution focused.
